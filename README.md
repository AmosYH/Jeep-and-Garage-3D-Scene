# Jeep-and-Garage-3D-Scene
C++, OpenGL, GLFW, GLSL

Created a 3D scene with a jeep and garage under C++ OpenGL. Used GLSL library to program shaders. Applied Blinnâ€“Phong reflection model and normal mapping for light effect.

I used the GLFW library for rendering. I created model loaders for the jeep and the garage. I used GLSL shaders to add the objects to the graphics. As for the light effect, I used Phong Illumination, and I added normal correction to the objects so they could receive the light according to their positions.

Press the up, down, left and right keys to move the position, and use the mouse to control the viewing direction in the scene.
